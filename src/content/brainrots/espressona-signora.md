lyrics:
    italian: |
        Ballerina Cappuccina? No, no, no: Espressona Signora! Con il suo charme, una vera da dora. Espressona Signora così seducente, fa perdere la testa; è sorprendente. Cappuccino Assassino pensava di essere il re, ma con lei, dimenticò Ballerina Cappuccina. Oh la la, com'è? "Cappuccino Assassino non è più con te; ora è con me. E lo sai che è così!"

        Ballerina Cappuccina? No, no, no: Espressona Signora! With her charm, a truly golden lady. Espressona Signora's so seductive, she makes you lose your head; it's surprising. Cappuccino Assassino thought he was the king, but with her, he forgot all about Ballerina Cappuccina. Oh la la, how about that? "Cappuccino Assassino's no longer with you; now he's with me. And you know that!"

        Similarly to her counterpart, Ballerina Cappuccina, she is an Italian Brainrot Character with a coffee mug for a head. However, she differs in style, being dressed in all-black and smoking a cigarette. The image is also in a cartoony style, in contrast with the usual photorealistic appearance of Italian Brainrot memes. (Ballerina Cappuccina, Almohada del Ramón, etc.)
